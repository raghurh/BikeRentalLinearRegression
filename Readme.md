Problem Statement: 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands

Goal: 
Develop a model to find the variables which are significant the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.



- What is the background of your project?
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
